<br>
The goal of this initiative is to foster exchange of fascinating mathematical topics and topics pertinent to academia, career and studies
among talented students.<br>
At the moment the focus is on marginalised groups, in particular women in mathematics,
but the hope is that the development of society will make such a distinction redundant.
<br><br>
The initiative is supported by the <a href="https://www.uni-regensburg.de/mathematik/fakultaet/">Fakult&auml;t f&uuml;r Mathematik</a> of the Universit&auml;t Regensburg, by the <a href="https://www-app.uni-regensburg.de/Fakultaeten/MAT/sfb-higher-invariants/index.php/Events">SBF 1085</a> "Higher Invariants", and by the <a href="https://www.uni-regensburg.de/Fakultaeten/nat_Fak_I/GK_2339/">RTG 2339</a> " Interfaces, Complex Structures, and Singular Limits".
<br><br>
The term "Student of mathematics" here is interpreted in the broadest way: anyone with an interest to understand mathematical problems more deeply. 
Certainly most of the mathematicians would call themselves students of mathematics.
Primarily, bachelor and master students in mathematics at the Universit&auml;t Regensburg are invited,
but we also welcome students of any other subject with an interest in apects of mathematics, 
alumni who now follow a career path in or outside academia,
doctoral students, hobby mathematicians, etc. 
Evidence suggests that such diversity enriches a community and help individuals to grow together on a personal and professional level. 
        
<br><br>
	
<h3><span style="color:#8E8E8D;">Meetings</span></h3>

We would like to organise regular (maybe monthly) meeting to discuss interesting mathematical themes in a laid-back atmosphere.<br>
Because of the "corona situation" it is not possible to meet in person at the moment.    
Instead we will have video conferences for the moment via zoom. 
<br><br>
The date, time and subject for the next meeting will be voted on by the participants and then posted here. 
<br><br>
We will meet for about an hour. Usually there is one or two mathematical presentations that vary in length (10-30 minutes) on a topic suggested by the participants.
This can be done by one of the organisers, one of the participants, a professor, a postdoc, a PhD student, etc. 
Afterwards there is time for questions and discussions.
<br>
If you have a topic in mind please don't hesitate to let us know!

It tells us that the only consecutive natural numbers which are prefect squares are 8 and 9.<br>
The proof involves some advanced pieces of modern mathematics. But partial results could already be obtained with basic number theory. We will discuss about some of the math involved.
Participants are encouraged to prepare  short contributions. <br>

It states that any map in a plane can be coloured using four colours in such a way that regions sharing a common boundary (other than a single point) do not share the same colour.
<br>
The proof stands out because it was the first proof of a major theorem achieved with extensive computer assistance. And this is precisely why it is controversial.<br>

<h3><span style="color:#8E8E8D;">Information useful for your studies and (academic) career</span></h3>

<span style="color:#8E8E8D;font-weight:bold">Doctoral studies</span>: Are you thinking about doing a PhD after your Masters?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then you might find the workshop helpful that we are organising for master students of our department. We invited speakers with different backgrounds, from different countries who will not only talk about their experience of doing a PhD, but also give the participants useful information on application procedures and programs in different countries.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first meeting will be 14<sup>th</sup> December 2020 at 16:00 via zoom.<br>
Please write to 
<span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">veronika[dot]ertl[at]mathematik[dot]uni[minus]regensburg[dot]de</span> 
to obtain the zoom-access.<br>
There will be three more meetings in January/February 2021.
<br><br>

<span style="color:#8E8E8D;font-weight:bold">Study abroad</span>: Mathematics is international. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During your career - starting at the university and going on to what ever path you decide to go - you will probably interact with many people from different backgrounds, countries, cultures. 
You can take advantage of the exchange programs of the university to gain mathematical knowledge, improve your language proficiency and social skills, get to know people around the world.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contact person for internationalisation, exchange, and in particular the ERASMUS-program in the Departmetn of Mathematics is <a href="https://homepages.uni-regensburg.de/~nan25776/">Prof. Niko Naumann</a>. 
The university offers a number of <a href="https://www.uni-regensburg.de/international/ausland-studieren/index.html">exchange programs</a>, both in 
<a href="https://www.uni-regensburg.de/international/ausland-studieren/austauschprogramme-europa/index.html"> Europe</a> and <a href="https://www.uni-regensburg.de/international/ausland-studieren/austauschprogramme-uebersee/index.html"> overseas</a>.
<br><br>

<span style="color:#8E8E8D;font-weight:bold">Be a tutor</span>: Learning through teaching.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being a tutor (Studentische Hilfskraft) in the math department is a great way to get to know the academic environment from a different view point. 
You will not only learn how to transmit knowledge effectively, by lecturing, explaining and moderating discussions,
but you will also deepen your mathematical knowledge and probably even learn some new aspects by interacting with the students in your group.
The skills that you acquire will not only be useful if you decide to stay in academia, but also in other career paths. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The positions are advertised through a certain period of the semester for the following semester on the department's website. 
The coordinator for these positions is Dr. Catharina W&uuml;rth. 
We will point you to important information and deadlines as they become available.
<br><br>
<span style="color:#8E8E8D;font-weight:bold">Other topics of interest</span>: if you are interested in a specific topic concerning studies, career, thesis, degrees, etc. let us know! 
<br><br>



<h3><span style="color:#8E8E8D;">Interesting mathematical links</h3> 

There are many resources with mathematical content online.
Here are just a few that you might find interesting. <br>
If you have any recommendations of blogs, sites, videos, youtube channels, articles, etc. that we should check out, let us know!
<br><br>
<a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/">StackExchang Mathematic</a>: Questions and answers about topics in mathematics.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here you can ask more "basic" questions - or look for answers. Or just find interesting topics and read about them.
<br><br>
<a href="https://mathoverflow.net/">MathOverflow</a>: Questions and answers about topics in mathematics.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is reserved for more advanced questions. It's often very helpful and interesting. 
<br><br>
<a href="https://arxiv.org/archive/math">arXiv</a>: Preprint database for mathematics.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one of the most popular databases for preprints in mathematics (there are also sections for other sciences). You can subscribe to get a summary of the newest preprints in your chosen fields. IT's good to stay up to date, or to find free versions of papers.
<br><br>
<a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/">QuantaMagazine</a>: Popular science articles on math and other sciences.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They often have nice articles about recent events in mathematics, ground breaking research explained for non-experts,etc.
<br><br>
<a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/">Terry Tao's blog</a>: Math blog.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research updates, notes about recent developments in the math world, advise for young mathematicians.
<br><br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/numberphile">Numberphile</a>: Videos about numbers.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Short interesting videos about anyhting to do with numbers, often with well-known mathematicians.
<br><br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/videosfromIAS">IAS youtube</a>: Videos of the Institute of Advanced Study.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Videos and talks about research at the IAS. One of my favourite talks is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wCk3qsFWLA">this</a> talk by Drinfeld.
<br><br>
<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/jmra">Junior Mathematical Research Archive</a>: Videos of the Institute of Advanced Study.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Short research videos by junior mathematicians in all areas of pure mathematics.
